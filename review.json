  "summary": "The updated command-line interface (CLI) supports output in markdown or JSON formats; however, it introduces several performance, maintainability, and security concerns. Key issues involve potential performance bottlenecks, maintainability challenges due to lack of organization and documentation, and critical security vulnerabilities with file handling and input validation.",

  "suggestions": [
    "Use more efficient string handling or generators in 'to_markdown' to reduce memory usage when assembling output.",
    "Implement asynchronous file write operations to prevent blocking the main thread during I/O operations.",
    "Benchmark output generation for various sizes of review results to assess performance impact and optimize accordingly.",
    "Refactor output formatting logic into a separate helper function for better readability and organization.",
    "Add docstrings for the new options parameters in the review function to clarify their purpose and usage.",
    "Use specific exceptions like IOError for file operations instead of a generic Exception to enhance error handling and debugging.",
    "Create additional tests covering error scenarios, specifically for file writing failures, to ensure robustness.",
    "Implement validation to check the output path for directory traversal vulnerabilities, restricting it to safe locations."
