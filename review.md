# Review Summary

The CLI tool transformation introduces new output formats and file path features, enhancing functionality. However, it contains significant issues regarding performance, maintainability, and security that require resolution for robustness and usability.

## Issues (7)

- **major**: The `output_path` parameter lacks validation against path traversal and unauthorized paths. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:27)
- **major**: The code can overwrite existing files without warning when `output_path` is specified, risking unintentional data loss. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:42)
- **major**: File operations lack exception handling, which may expose stack traces to users on errors. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:40)
- **major**: The new command options are undocumented in the CLI help string, reducing user guidance. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:11)
- **minor**: Repeated calls to `.lower()` in the output format check can be eliminated by normalizing the input once. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:54)
- **minor**: High memory consumption may occur when converting large review results to markdown due to string concatenation in the `to_markdown` function. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/interfaces.py:60)
- **minor**: The lengthy 'review' method should be refactored into smaller methods for improved readability and organization. (src/ai_toolbox/commands/review/cli.py:29)

## Suggestions

- Implement path validation for `output_path` to prevent path traversal attacks.
- Add a confirmation prompt before overwriting files at the specified `output_path`.
- Enhance exception handling for file operations to prevent exposure of sensitive internal state when errors occur.
- Document the new command line options ('--output' and '--output-path') in the CLI help string for improved user guidance.
- Normalize the output format string once before checks instead of calling .lower() multiple times.
- Use a list accumulation approach for markdown strings in `to_markdown` to optimize performance for large inputs.
- Refactor the 'review' method into smaller helper functions for output preparation for better readability and maintainability.
