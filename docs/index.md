# AI Toolbox Documentation Index

Welcome — this project is documented with a few small pages that explain how to run the CLI and the included commands.

See:

- `cli.md` — CLI usage and global options
- `commands.md` — per-command details and behavior
- `contributing.md` — development and testing notes

If you'd like a full website generated (Sphinx, MkDocs), I can add a basic MkDocs configuration and build pipeline as a follow-up.
