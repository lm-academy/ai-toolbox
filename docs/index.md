# AI Toolbox Documentation

This repository contains a small CLI-first toolkit that demonstrates how to wire LLM calls into developer workflows. The documentation below summarizes the implemented features, how to use the CLI, and how to set up a local development environment.

Pages

- `cli.md` — CLI usage and global options
- `commands.md` — per-command details and behavior
- `contributing.md` — development, testing and packaging notes

If you want a generated website (MkDocs / Sphinx), the repo is small and can be wired to a docs site; open a follow-up issue or I can add a basic MkDocs config.
